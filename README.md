# Lords Attendance


## Challenge

To practice using the Parliment Digital Services APIs, create a program which can complete the following user stories:

### User Story 1

> As a member of the public
> I want to be able to find which Lords were present in the House of Lords on 30/1/2018
> So that I can see what overall percentage of Lords attended.

### User Story 2
> As a member of the public
> So I can see which Lords attended on which day
> I want to be able to search for a specific lord and a specific sitting.
